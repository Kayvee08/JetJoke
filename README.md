## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Project Info : 
**JetJoke App** is build to demonstrate the use of Clean Architecture + MVVM in Android App Development. App is mainly divided into 3 layers i.e ```data```, ```domain``` & ```app``` (presentation).
It also showcase the implemetation of some of the Modern Jetpack Architecture Component.

## üìö Libraries Used :
* [Kotlin][0] : Kotlin is statically typed & first-class language for Android Development.
* [Coroutines][1] : For Asynchronus or non-blocking operations.
* [Flows][2] : Data Streaming API which is built on top of Coroutines.
* [Jetpack Compose][3] : Toolkit for building native UI in a declarative way.
* [Splash Screen API][4] : Launch app with animation of launcher icon.
* [Retrofit][5] : Type-safe REST client for Android to consume RESTful web services.
* [Dagger Hilt][6] : Dependency injection library for Android.

## üß∞ Other Tools :
* [Kotlin DSL][7] : For writing gradle script for Kotlin is more readable and offers better compile-time.
* [Version Catalog][8] : Declaring gradle dependencies & plugins in central place.
* [Github Actions(CI/CD)][9] : Automate the build, test, and deployment pipeline through Github Actions.
* [Renovate][10] : To keep the app dependencies up-tp-date automatically.

## üèóÔ∏è App Architecture :
App is build using Clean Architecture design pattern. Which consist of three module as follows :
* [**app**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/JetJoke/tree/master/app) - This module is responsible for handling user interaction, displaying data and managing user interface. Usually this module is decoupled from bossiness logic and communicate with domain module for accessing any data.
* [**domain**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/JetJoke/tree/master/domain) - In this module contains core bussiness logic and it doesn't contains any platform related api usage and should only use java/kotlin language apis.
* [**data**](https://github.com/swapnil-musale/JetJoke/tree/master/data) - This module is mainly responsible for accessing data from remote or local source which is being called from domain module only.
